# Malware Defender
Malware Defender is a web application designed to scan .exe files and determine whether they contain malware or not. It leverages machine learning algorithms to perform malware detection and provides detailed information about the scanned file.
## Features
- **Malware Detection**: The application utilizes machine learning algorithms to detect whether a scanned .exe file contains malware or is safe.
- **File Analysis**: Malware Defender analyzes various attributes and characteristics of the file to assess its safety.
- **Detailed Information**: The application provides detailed information about the scanned file, including DllCharacteristics, Machine, MajorSubsystemVersion, ResourcesMaxEntropy, SectionsMaxEntropy, SectionsMeanEntropy, SizeOfOptionalHeader, SizeOfStackReserve, Subsystem, and VersionInformationSize.
- **User Interface**: Malware Defender offers a user-friendly web interface for easy file upload and scanning.
- **Background Indication**: The application visually indicates the malware detection result by changing the background color to red for malware detected and green for safe files.
- **Error Handling**: Malware Defender provides warnings for incorrect file types and missing file uploads to enhance user experience and ensure accurate scanning.
  
## Attributes
- **DllCharacteristics**: Identifies the DLL characteristics of the scanned file.
- **Machine**: Determines the machine architecture for which the executable was created.
- **MajorSubsystemVersion**: Retrieves the major subsystem version of the executable.
- **ResourcesMaxEntropy**: Calculates the maximum entropy of the resources in the file.
- **SectionsMaxEntropy**: Computes the maximum entropy among the sections in the executable.
- **SectionsMeanEntropy**: Computes the mean entropy of the sections in the executable.
- **SizeOfOptionalHeader**: Retrieves the size of the optional header in the file.
- **SizeOfStackReserve**: Determines the size of the stack to be reserved for the executable.
- **Subsystem**: Identifies the subsystem required to run the executable.
- **VersionInformationSize**: Retrieves the size of the version information in the file.
